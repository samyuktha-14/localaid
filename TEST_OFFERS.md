## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any posts"

**Check:**
1. Both users in **same neighborhood** (Anna Nagar)
2. Click **refresh button** (circular arrow)
3. Filter set to **"All Types"**
4. Backend server running (`npm run dev` in backend folder)
5. No console errors (press F12)

### "Filter doesn't work"

**Fix:**
1. Click refresh button after changing filter
2. Should auto-update now (fixed in this update)

### "Post count shows 0"

**Cause:** No posts created yet or neighborhood mismatch

**Fix:**
1. Create a post first
2. Verify neighborhoods match exactly
