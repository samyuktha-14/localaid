# LocalAid Application Flow & Concept

## üìã Overview
LocalAid is a community-based platform where neighbors can help each other by posting requests for help or offering assistance. The platform connects help seekers with helpers in their neighborhood.

## üîÑ Application Flow

### 1. **User Registration & Login**
- Users sign up with their details (name, email, password, phone, address)
- System captures user location for neighborhood-based features
- Users can log in to access the platform

### 2. **Create Help Request or Offer**
A user can create two types of posts:
- **Request Help**: When you need assistance (e.g., "Need help moving furniture")
- **Offer Help**: When you want to help others (e.g., "Offering free tutoring")

**Post includes:**
- Title and description
- Category (food, transport, tools, tutoring, childcare, etc.)
- Urgency level (low, medium, high)
- Neighborhood and location

### 3. **Browse & Respond to Posts**
- Users can view posts in their neighborhood
- Filter by type (request/offer) and category
- Respond to posts with a message offering help

### 4. **Helper Assignment**
- **Post author** (help seeker) reviews responses
- Selects a helper by clicking "Assign" button
- Post status changes from "active" to "in-progress"
- Only one helper can be assigned per request

### 5. **üí¨ Chat Between Help Seeker & Helper** *(NEW FEATURE)*
Once a helper is assigned:
- A "Chat" button appears for both parties
- Help seeker and helper can communicate directly
- Real-time messaging for coordination
- Chat is private - only between these two users

### 6. **Complete the Help Exchange**
- Either the help seeker OR helper can mark the post as completed
- Post status changes to "completed"
- Helper earns karma points (+10) and increases helped count

### 7. **‚≠ê Rating System** *(FIXED)*
**IMPORTANT**: Only the **help seeker (post author)** can rate the helper!

**Why this makes sense:**
- The person who receives help should evaluate the helper's service
- Prevents mutual rating pressure
- Focuses on the quality of help provided

**Rating process:**
1. After completion, help seeker sees "Rate Your Helper" form
2. Rates 1-5 stars with optional comment
3. Rating updates helper's average rating
4. High ratings (4-5 stars) give bonus karma points

### 8. **Gamification & Leaderboard**
- Users earn karma for helping others
- Badges awarded at milestones:
  - Top Helper (10+ helps)
  - Community Elder (50+ helps)
- Leaderboard shows top contributors per neighborhood

## üéØ Key Concepts

### Post Types
1. **Request Posts**: "I need help with..."
   - Created by help seekers
   - Others respond offering assistance
   - Author selects helper

2. **Offer Posts**: "I can help with..."
   - Created by helpers
   - Others respond accepting the offer
   - Author selects who to help

### Post Status Flow
```
Active ‚Üí In-Progress ‚Üí Completed
   ‚Üì          ‚Üì            ‚Üì
Create    Assigned    Rated (optional)
         + Chat
```

### User Roles in a Transaction
- **Post Author**: Person who created the post (help seeker or offerer)
- **Assigned Helper**: Person selected to provide help
- **Chat Access**: Only available between post author and assigned helper
